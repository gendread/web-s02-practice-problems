    PROBLEM 5 (DEBUGGING): The expected output of the code below is to split the myString string into an array using the , character as a separator, and then print out the resulting array to the console. However, when you run this code, you notice that myArray is an empty array.

    Here is more information about the split method: https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/String/split

    const myString = "apple,banana,orange,pear";
    const myArray = myString.split();

    console.log(myArray);

    const myString = "apple,banana,orange,pear";
    const myArray = [myString.split(',')]; //comma is being used as the diveder point between words

    console.log(myArray);
